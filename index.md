# Constellar Studio 星合工作室

Constellar Studio focuses on using satellite and airborne radar data to study changes on the Earth’s surface. We provide services in infrastructure monitoring, surface deformation and change detection, and three-dimensional reconstruction of the Earth’s internal structure.

Our work includes processing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from a wide range of sources, including satellite and airborne platforms. We analyze surface deformation at different spatial and temporal scales, supporting the identification of risks affecting roads, bridges, buildings, and other critical infrastructure. We also offer early detection and environmental consulting for natural hazard events such as wildfires, floods, landslides, and permafrost degradation.

Through careful analysis of radar data, we aim to support decision-making in engineering, environmental protection, and land management, helping reduce risk and improve understanding of changes in both natural and built environments.

## What We Do

- Analysis of satellite and airborne SAR data to study changes on the Earth’s surface  
- Surface deformation measurement, and change detection across multiple spatial and temporal scales  
- Risk identification in roads, bridges, buildings, and other critical infrastructure
- Detection and environmental consulting for natural hazards such as wildfires, floods, landslides, and permafrost degradation
